<h1 align="center">Employee Payroll System </h1>

## Introduction:

**Welcome to the `Employee Payroll System` repository! This Java project is designed to manage a payroll system for both full-time and part-time employees. The system is implemented using object-oriented principles, including abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism.**

## Overview:

**The core structure of the system revolves around the Employee class, serving as an abstract base class for both full-time and part-time employees. The project demonstrates the use of inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism to create a flexible and extensible payroll management system.**

## Project Structure:

- **Employee Class:** An abstract class representing common attributes and behaviors of all employees.
- **FullTimeEmployee Class:** A class extending the `Employee` class, specifically designed for full-time employees with a fixed monthly salary.
- **PartTimeEmployee Class:** Another subclass of `Employee`, tailored for part-time employees with hourly wages.
- **PayrollSystem Class:** A class managing a list of employees, providing functionality to add, remove, and display employee details.

## Features:

- **Abstraction and Inheritance:** Utilizes object-oriented principles for creating an abstract `Employee` class and specific subclasses.
- **Polymorphism:** Demonstrates polymorphism by overriding methods such as `calculateSalary` and `toString` in subclasses.
- **Flexible Employee Types:** Supports both full-time and part-time employees, allowing for diverse payroll scenarios.
- **Payroll Management:** Implements a `PayrollSystem` class for adding, removing, and displaying employee details.
- **Simple Usage Example:** The `EmployeeUse` class provides a basic example of how to use the Employee Payroll System.

## How to Use:

The `EmployeeUse` class demonstrates the basic usage of the Employee Payroll System. It creates instances of full-time and part-time employees, adds them to the payroll system, removes an employee, and displays the remaining employee details.

## Getting Started:

- **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rajeevkrS/Employee-Payroll-System
